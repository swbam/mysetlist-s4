- **Changes**:
  - Removed geolocation hook import
  - Removed "Near Me" button and related functionality
  - Removed location-related imports (MapPin, Loader2, X icons)
  - Simplified search interface to basic text and filters only

#### `apps/web/app/shows/components/shows-map.tsx`
- **Status**: No changes needed - already implemented as placeholder

#### `apps/web/app/venues/[slug]/components/venue-map.tsx`
- **Status**: No changes needed - already implemented as placeholder with Google Maps fallback

### 2. Documentation Files

#### `VERCEL_ENV_SETUP.md`
- **Removed**:
  - Mapbox environment variable section
  - References to `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN`
  - Maps & Geolocation documentation section

#### `mysetlist-docs/04-core-features-and-components.md`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated "Venue Search with Location" section
  - Removed geolocation hook usage examples
  - Simplified code examples to basic venue search
  - Maintained note about future map implementation

#### `mysetlist-docs/01-project-overview-and-architecture.md`
- **Changes**:
  - Changed "PostGIS: Location-based queries for venues" to "PostgreSQL Extensions: Advanced querying capabilities"
  - Changed "Location-based venue discovery" to "Venue discovery and search functionality"

### 3. Build Files
- **Removed**: All generated Next.js build cache (`.next` directory)
- **Updated**: `pnpm-lock.yaml` automatically cleaned by reinstalling dependencies

## Dependencies Removed

All Mapbox-related dependencies were automatically removed from `pnpm-lock.yaml`:
- `mapbox-gl@3.13.0`
- `@mapbox/jsonlint-lines-primitives@2.0.2`
- `@mapbox/mapbox-gl-supported@3.0.0` 
- `@mapbox/point-geometry@0.1.0`
- `@mapbox/tiny-sdf@2.0.6`
- `@mapbox/unitbezier@0.0.1`
- `@mapbox/vector-tile@1.3.1`
- `@mapbox/whoots-js@3.1.0`
- `@types/mapbox-gl@3.4.1`
- `@types/mapbox__point-geometry@0.1.4`
- `@types/mapbox__vector-tile@1.3.4`

## Features Affected

### 1. Venue Discovery
- **Before**: Interactive map with venue markers, user location, and geolocation-based search
- **After**: Grid-based venue list with search and filtering (no location services)
- **Impact**: Users can still search and discover venues but without map visualization or location-based filtering

### 2. Venue Pages
- **Before**: Individual venue pages had interactive maps showing venue location
- **After**: Venue pages show placeholder for future map implementation
- **Impact**: Venue location information still available in text format

### 3. Shows Page
- **Before**: Map view tab was already implemented as placeholder
- **After**: No change - continues to show "Coming Soon" placeholder
- **Impact**: No functional change

## Environment Variables Removed

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` - No longer needed or documented

## Functionality Preserved

### 1. Venue Search
- Text-based search by venue name and location still works
- Venue type filtering (Arena, Theater, Club, etc.) preserved
- Capacity-based filtering preserved
- Grid/List view toggle maintained

### 2. Venue Information
- All venue data (name, address, capacity, etc.) still accessible
- Venue pages still display all information
- Search and discovery functionality intact

### 3. Shows and Setlists
- No impact on show or setlist functionality
- All existing features remain fully functional

## Testing Results

### Build Test
- ✅ Application builds successfully without errors
- ✅ No Mapbox-related dependencies remain
- ✅ All components render without runtime errors
- ✅ TypeScript compilation succeeds

### Functional Test Areas
- ✅ Venue search and filtering works
- ✅ Venue pages load and display information
- ✅ Shows page renders with working list view
- ✅ Navigation and routing unaffected

## Future Implementation Notes

### For Future Map Integration
The component structure has been preserved to make future map integration straightforward:

1. **Component Interfaces**: All map component props and interfaces remain unchanged
2. **Placeholder Structure**: Clear placeholders indicate where map functionality should be added
3. **Documentation**: Clear notes in code and docs about future implementation
4. **Environment Setup**: Documentation can be easily updated to include new map service variables

### Alternative Map Services
If maps are re-implemented, consider these alternatives:
- **Leaflet**: Open-source mapping library
- **Google Maps**: Widely supported with good documentation
- **Apple Maps**: For iOS-focused applications
- **OpenStreetMap**: Community-driven mapping solution

## Summary

The MySetlist application has been successfully converted from a Mapbox-integrated application to a web-only application without mapping capabilities. All core functionality remains intact, with map features replaced by clear placeholders for future implementation. The codebase is now free of all Mapbox dependencies and references while maintaining a structure that supports future map integration with any mapping service.
