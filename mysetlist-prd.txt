# MYSETLIST WEB APP - PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

MySetlist is a setlist voting web application that enables users to search for artists, view their shows, and interact with setlists and song catalogs. The application requires a complete finalization with **world-class engineering and design quality** while maintaining strict adherence to **next-forge architecture patterns**. This PRD mandates **ULTRATHINKING** every decision 3x before implementation and deploying **6 specialized sub-agents in parallel** to ensure rapid, high-quality completion.

- **ULTRATHINK**: Optimize all database queries and API calls

## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### Architecture Standards
- **Framework**: Next.js with next-forge starter structure (MANDATORY)
- **API Structure**: **CRITICAL CHANGE** - Remove separate API app from apps folder, consolidate ALL API functionality into apps/web/app/api routes
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with design system implementation
- **Database**: Existing ORM configurations with proper schema validation
- **TypeScript**: 100% type safety throughout codebase
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests with accessibility testing
- **Performance**: Bundle optimization and load time targets

### API Consolidation Requirements
- **IMPERATIVE**: Eliminate apps/api folder completely
- **ULTRATHINK**: Migrate all API functionality to apps/web/app/api structure
- Ensure all database operations use unified API routes within web app
- Maintain next-forge patterns for API route organization
- Validate all sync functions work with consolidated API structure

### Development Methodology
- **ULTRATHINKING**: Every decision analyzed 3x before implementation
- **Parallel Development**: 6 specialized sub-agents working simultaneously
- **Code Conflict Prevention**: Clear domain boundaries and coordination protocols
- **Quality Gates**: Continuous validation at each implementation phase

### Sub-Agent Coordination Requirements
1. **Navigation Agent**: Route handlers, middleware, layout files only
2. **Database Agent**: **UPDATED SCOPE** - Database models, sync utilities, cron jobs, AND consolidation of apps/api into apps/web/app/api structure
3. **Frontend Data Agent**: **UPDATED SCOPE** - Unified API routes within apps/web/app/api, data hooks, state management, server actions
4. **UI Component Agent**: React components, styling, design system only
5. **Artist/Show Page Agent**: Page components, data binding logic, user flow implementation only
6. **Performance Agent**: Config files, environment setup, optimization, build process only

### API Consolidation Mandate
- **SUB-AGENT 2 & 3 COORDINATION**: Remove entire apps/api folder and migrate ALL functionality to apps/web/app/api
- **ULTRATHINK**: Ensure zero functionality loss during API consolidation
- Validate all existing API endpoints are properly migrated to unified structure
- Test all sync operations work with new API architecture
- Maintain next-forge API route patterns and conventions

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Functional Requirements
- **Zero navigation crashes** - All routes and links function perfectly
- **Complete data sync flow** - Artist click → full data synchronization → display
- **Trending page loads data** - Real-time trending content display
- **Artist pages show all data** - Shows, setlists, song catalogs fully populated
- **Seamless user journey** - Search → artist → show → setlist flow works flawlessly
- **API consolidation complete** - Single unified API structure in apps/web/app/api

### Performance Targets
- **Sub-second page load times** across all pages
- **Optimal bundle size** with proper code splitting
- **Responsive design** functioning on all device types
- **Accessibility compliance** WCAG 2.1 AA minimum
- **100% TypeScript coverage** with strict mode

### Quality Standards
- **World-class engineering quality** with next-forge patterns
- **Professional code organization** ready for team collaboration
- **Comprehensive testing** with unit and accessibility tests
- **Error handling and loading states** throughout application
- **Production-ready deployment** configuration

## PARALLEL IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### 6 SUB-AGENTS WORKING SIMULTANEOUSLY
**IMPERATIVE**: Deploy specialized agents in parallel with strict domain boundaries

#### COORDINATION CHECKPOINTS
1. **Initial Audit Phase**: All agents report findings and plan
2. **API Consolidation Phase**: Sub-Agents 2 & 3 coordinate apps/api removal
3. **Integration Phase**: Validate all components work together
4. **Final Testing Phase**: End-to-end testing and quality assurance

#### QUALITY ASSURANCE PROTOCOLS
- **ULTRATHINK** every decision 3x before implementation
- **Domain isolation** - agents avoid overlapping file modifications
- **Integration testing** after each major milestone
- **Performance validation** throughout development process
