# MySetlist App Completion - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan provides a roadmap to complete the core MySetlist concert setlist voting application.

## CONCLUSION

This implementation plan reflects the **actual current state** of the MySetlist application. While the project has excellent foundational architecture, **critical execution gaps** prevent core functionality from working.

**The immediate focus must be on Phase 1: Foundation Repair** - fixing database connectivity and TypeScript compilation errors. Only after these critical blockers are resolved can meaningful progress be made on the remaining features.

**The gap between infrastructure and working features is substantial** but addressable with focused debugging and development effort. The architecture is sound, but the execution layer requires significant work to reach production readiness.
