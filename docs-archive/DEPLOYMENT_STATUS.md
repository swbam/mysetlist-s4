# MySetlist Deployment Status ✅

## 🚀 Automatic Deployments Configured

Your project is now configured for automatic Vercel deployments!

### What Just Happened:
1. ✅ Fixed Vercel configuration issues (cron jobs, functions)
2. ✅ Enabled automatic deployments for your branch
3. ✅ Pushed all changes to GitHub
4. ✅ Vercel should now be building and deploying automatically

### 🔗 Check Your Deployments:

1. **Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/swbams-projects/windhoek
   - Look for a new deployment in progress
   - Should show "Building..." or "Ready"

2. **GitHub Repo**: https://github.com/swbam/mysetlist-s4
   - Check commits for ✅ (success) or ❌ (failure) marks
   - These appear after Vercel finishes building

3. **Live URLs**:
   - **Preview (your branch)**: Check Vercel dashboard for the unique URL
   - **Production (when merged to main)**: https://theset.live

### 🎯 What Happens Now:

Every time you push to GitHub:
- **mysetlist-completion-fix branch** → Preview deployment
- **main branch** → Production deployment (theset.live)
- **Any other branch** → Preview deployment

### 📋 Next Steps:

1. **Check Vercel Dashboard** for build status
2. **Verify deployment** by visiting the preview URL
3. **Set environment variables** in Vercel if not already done:
   - All Supabase credentials
   - API keys (Spotify, Ticketmaster, SetlistFM)
   - See `.env.production.example` for full list

### 🚨 If Deployment Fails:

1. Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
2. Common issues:
   - Missing environment variables
   - TypeScript errors (currently ignored)
   - Build timeout (increase if needed)

### 📝 Configuration Files:
- `vercel.json` - Deployment configuration
- `.env.production.example` - Required environment variables
- `VERCEL_AUTO_DEPLOY_GUIDE.md` - Detailed setup guide
