# MySetlist Database Cleanup Summary

## Date: 2025-07-21
## Supabase Project ID: yzwkimtdaabyjbpykquu

## 🎯 Cleanup Objectives
1. Fix user table inconsistencies between `public.users` and `auth.users`
2. Remove duplicate voting tables
3. Remove duplicate venue tips tables
4. Standardize timestamp columns to use timezone
5. Add performance indexes

## ✅ Completed Actions

### 1. User Data Cleanup
- **Problem**: 3 demo users in `public.users` vs 2 real users in `auth.users`
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed demo user votes (2 records)
  - Set `created_by` to NULL for 76 setlists created by demo users
  - Deleted demo users from `public.users`
  - Synced real auth users to `public.users`
- **Result**: Both tables now have 2 users and are in sync

### 2. Removed Duplicate Tables
- **Dropped**: `song_votes` table (was empty, duplicated `votes` functionality)
- **Dropped**: `venue_insider_tips` table (was empty, duplicated `venue_tips`)
- **Kept**: `setlist_votes` for future functionality (voting on entire setlists)

### 3. Timestamp Standardization
- Converted all timestamp columns to use timezone (`timestamp with time zone`)
- Affected tables: `artists`, `artist_stats`, `shows`, `setlists`, `songs`
- Ensures consistency across the database

### 4. Performance Indexes Added
- Foreign key indexes on all relationship columns
- Performance indexes on commonly queried columns:
  - `artists.slug`, `artists.trending_score`
  - `shows.date`, `shows.status`, `shows.trending_score`
  - `songs.spotify_id`
  - `sync_jobs` composite index for scheduling
  - `sync_logs` index for efficient log queries

### 5. User Sync Automation
- Created `ensure_public_user()` function
- Added trigger on `auth.users` to automatically sync new users to `public.users`
- Prevents future user table mismatches

## 📊 Current Database State

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Artists | 28 |
| Total Songs | 640 |
| Total Shows | 28 |
| Total Venues | 10 |
| Total Setlists | 76 |
| Total Users | 2 (synced) |
| Active Votes | 0 |

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

1. **Data Integrity**: User tables are now properly synchronized
2. **Performance**: Added 18 strategic indexes for faster queries
3. **Consistency**: All timestamps now use timezone-aware format
4. **Simplicity**: Removed redundant tables that were causing confusion
5. **Automation**: Future auth users automatically sync to public users

## 📝 Migration File
The cleanup was performed using SQL commands and saved to:
`/supabase/migrations/20250721_database_cleanup.sql`

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. The database is now clean and optimized
2. Continue with the consolidated cron job implementation
3. Test the new sync infrastructure with the clean database
4. Monitor performance improvements from the new indexes

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- 76 setlists now have `created_by = NULL` (from demo users)
- This is acceptable as the column is nullable
- Future setlists will properly track the creating user
- The trigger ensures new auth users are automatically added to public.users

## ✅ Test Results

### Database Connectivity
- **Direct SQL queries**: ✅ Working perfectly
- **User table sync**: ✅ 2 users properly synced between auth.users and public.users
- **Data integrity**: ✅ All foreign key relationships intact

### Performance Testing
- **Index usage confirmed**: The new `idx_artists_trending_score` index is being used
- **Query performance**: Trending query executes in 0.076ms (excellent!)
- **Sample trending data working**:
  - Taylor Swift: 56,049 trending score, 3 shows
  - Billie Eilish: 45,800 trending score, 2 shows, 5 setlists
  - The Weeknd: 35,628 trending score, 3 shows

### Application Testing
- **Server startup**: ✅ Application starts without database errors
- **API endpoints**: Need to verify with proper environment setup
- **Frontend pages**: May need cache clearing after schema changes
