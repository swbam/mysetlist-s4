# Database Security Fixes - Comprehensive Summary

This document outlines all the critical database security issues that have been identified and fixed in the MySetlist application.

## 🚨 Critical Issues Addressed

### 1. RLS Disabled on Public Tables ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Several critical tables had Row Level Security (RLS) disabled, allowing unrestricted access.

**Tables Fixed**:
- `user_activity_log` - Contains sensitive user activity data
- `pipeline_jobs` - Background job processing data
- `schema_migrations` - Database schema versioning data

**Solution**: Enabled RLS on all critical tables and created appropriate policies.

### 2. Security Definer View Issue ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The `cron_job_status` view was using `SECURITY DEFINER` inappropriately, potentially allowing privilege escalation.

**Solution**: 
- Recreated view with `security_invoker=true` 
- Added proper access controls limiting view to admin users only
- Implemented safe data exposure patterns

### 3. Missing or Inadequate RLS Policies ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Tables had RLS enabled but lacked proper policies, effectively blocking all access.

**Solution**: Created comprehensive RLS policies for all tables based on data sensitivity and access patterns.

### 4. Materialized View Security Issues ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: `trending_artists` and `trending_shows` materialized views couldn't have RLS policies directly.

**Solution**: 
- Created secure wrapper functions `get_trending_artists()` and `get_trending_shows()`
- Functions use `SECURITY DEFINER` with proper access controls
- Public access through functions instead of direct materialized view access

### 5. Service Role Permissions for Cron Jobs ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Service role lacked necessary permissions for automated cron job operations.

**Solution**: 
- Granted comprehensive permissions to service role for all necessary tables
- Created specific policies allowing service role operations
- Ensured cron jobs can function without compromising security

## 📋 Security Policies Implemented

### User Data Protection
- **user_activity_log**: Users can only view their own activity; admins/moderators can view all
- **user_profiles**: Users control their own profiles; public profiles viewable by all
- **user_follows_artists**: Users manage their own follows; viewing based on privacy settings

### Admin-Only Tables
- **pipeline_jobs**: Only admins and service role can manage background jobs
- **admin_notifications**: Admin-only access for system notifications
- **content_moderation**: Admin/moderator access for content management
- **system_health**: Admin-only system monitoring data

### Public Data Tables
- **artists, shows, venues, songs**: Public read access for discovery features
- **setlists, setlist_songs**: Public read access for voting features
- **votes**: Public read access; users can only modify their own votes

### Schema Management
- **schema_migrations**: Admin read access; service role full access for deployments

## 🎯 Access Control Matrix

| Table/Resource | Anonymous | Authenticated User | Admin | Service Role |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| user_activity_log | ❌ | Own data only | ✅ All data | ✅ All data |
| pipeline_jobs | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ All operations | ✅ All operations |
| schema_migrations | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Read only | ✅ All operations |
| artists | ✅ Read | ✅ Read | ✅ Read | ✅ All operations |
| shows | ✅ Read | ✅ Read | ✅ Read | ✅ All operations |
| votes | ✅ Read | ✅ Own votes | ✅ All votes | ✅ All operations |
| cron_job_status | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Read | ✅ Read |
| trending data | ✅ Via functions | ✅ Via functions | ✅ Via functions | ✅ Direct access |

## 🔍 Validation Process

### Automatic Validation
Run the validation script to check:
```sql
\i validate_database_security.sql
```

### Security Report Generation
Generate comprehensive security reports:
```sql
SELECT generate_security_report();
```

### Ongoing Monitoring
```sql
-- Check for security issues
SELECT * FROM detect_policy_bypasses();

-- Monitor suspicious activity
SELECT * FROM monitor_suspicious_activity(24); -- Last 24 hours
```

## 📊 Security Metrics

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### 1. Apply Security Fixes
```bash
# Run the main security fix migration
psql -f supabase/migrations/20250728_fix_database_security.sql

# Install security monitoring utilities
psql -f supabase/migrations/20250728_security_utilities.sql
```

## 🛡 Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users and roles have minimal necessary permissions
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
3. **Privacy by Design**: User data protected with granular access controls
4. **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities
5. **Secure Defaults**: All new tables require explicit security configuration
