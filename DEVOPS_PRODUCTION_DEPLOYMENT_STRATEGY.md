## 📋 CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

### Pipeline Stages

1. **Code Quality Gates**
   - TypeScript compilation
   - ESLint + Prettier checks
   - Security scanning (Snyk, Trivy)
   - License compliance

2. **Test Suites**
   - Unit tests (Vitest) - Parallelized across 4 shards
   - Integration tests
   - E2E tests (Cypress) - Multi-browser
   - Performance tests (Lighthouse CI)

3. **Build & Optimization**
   - Next.js production build
   - Bundle size analysis
   - Image optimization
   - Code splitting verification

4. **Security Scanning**
   - Container vulnerability scanning
   - Dependency audit
   - SAST/DAST analysis
   - Secret scanning

5. **Deployment**
   - Staging deployment (automatic)
   - Production deployment (manual approval)
   - Database migrations
   - Cache warming

### Deployment Workflow

```yaml
Production Deployment Flow:
1. Developer creates PR → feature branch
2. CI runs all checks (15-20 min)
3. PR approved → merge to develop
4. Auto-deploy to staging
5. QA validation on staging
6. Release manager approves production deployment
7. Blue-green deployment to production
8. Automated smoke tests
9. Gradual traffic shift (canary)
10. Full rollout or rollback
```

## 🛡️ Production Hardening

### Security Measures

1. **Network Security**
   - Cloudflare WAF rules
   - DDoS protection (Layer 3/4/7)
   - Rate limiting (50 req/min for API)
