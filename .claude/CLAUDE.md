# MySetlist Web App - Critical Issues & Implementation Gaps

---

## üìã **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

After exhaustive analysis of the codebase, documentation, database schema, and current status, I've identified **9 critical categories** of issues requiring immediate attention. The app has **substantial infrastructure** in place but suffers from **performance bottlenecks**, **incomplete features**, and **technical debt** that prevent production readiness.

---

## üö® **CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE FIX**

### 1. **NAVIGATION & USER EXPERIENCE FAILURES**

#### **Logo Not Linked to Homepage** ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **Location**: `apps/web/app/components/header/index.tsx:127-130`
- **Issue**: Logo is just an Image component, not wrapped in Link
- **Fix Required**:

```tsx
<Link href="/" className="flex items-center gap-2">
  <Image src={Logo} alt="Logo" width={24} height={24} className="dark:invert" />
  <p className="whitespace-nowrap font-semibold">MySetlist</p>
</Link>
```

#### **Auth Navigation Visibility** ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **Issue**: Sign-in/Sign-up only visible in user menu dropdown, not prominent in main nav
- **Impact**: Poor UX for new users
- **Solution**: Add auth buttons to main header when user not authenticated

#### **Page Route Failures** üî•

- **Status**: `/shows` and `/artists` returning 404s according to CURRENTSTATUS.md
- **Root Cause**: Unknown - requires investigation
- **Files Exist**: Components and pages are present but not accessible

### 2. **PERFORMANCE BOTTLENECKS** üî•

#### **App Slower Than Next-Forge Starter**

- **Symptoms**: Navigation lag, slow page loads
- **Potential Causes**:
  - Unoptimized database queries
  - Missing React.memo() on heavy components
  - Excessive re-renders
  - Large bundle sizes
  - Service worker cache conflicts

#### **Service Worker Cache Issues**

- **Problem**: Legacy PWA service worker causing stale content
- **Status**: Partial fix implemented (`DisableServiceWorker` component)
- **Remaining**: Some users still affected, need cache invalidation strategy

### 3. **TECHNICAL DEBT AVALANCHE** üî•

#### **TypeScript Errors**

- **Scale**: "Hundreds of tsc errors across mono-repo"
- **Priority Areas**:
  1. `packages/database` - Core functionality
  2. `packages/auth` - Security critical
  3. `apps/web` pages - User-facing

#### **Critical Dependency Warnings**

- **Issue**: Webpack/Next warnings for OpenTelemetry imports
- **Impact**: Build performance, potential production issues
- **Status**: "Benign but should be silenced before prod"

#### **Environment Schema Misalignment**

- **Problem**: `packages/*/env.ts` out of sync with `.env.example`
- **Command Exists**: `pnpm check-env` script
- **Action Required**: Run validation and update schemas

### 4. **BROKEN TEST INFRASTRUCTURE** üî•

#### **Cypress & React Testing Library Failures**

- **Root Cause**: Tests reference removed Clerk authentication flows
- **Impact**: No quality assurance coverage
- **Scope**: "Many tests" need rewrite for Supabase Auth
- **Blocking**: CI/CD pipeline effectiveness

### 5. **BUILD SYSTEM INSTABILITY** ‚ö†Ô∏è

#### **Cache Corruption Issues**

- **Symptoms**: Missing chunks `zod@3.25.71.js`, `./8258.js` after hot-reload
- **Current Fix**: Manual `rm -rf apps/web/.next` and restart
- **Needed**: Automated cache management in CI/CD

#### **Apps/API Consolidation Status**

- **Requirement**: Remove `apps/api` folder, migrate to `apps/web/app/api`
- **Status**: Unclear completion - needs verification
- **Risk**: Duplicate API endpoints, deployment confusion
