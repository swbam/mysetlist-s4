# MySetlist App Completion - Requirements Document

## Introduction

MySetlist is a concert setlist voting platform built on Next-Forge that allows users to discover artists, view shows, and vote on setlists. The core vision is to create a seamless experience where users can search for artists, explore their upcoming shows, and participate in setlist predictions through community voting.

**CURRENT STATUS: 35-40% COMPLETE** - The application has excellent foundational architecture but core user-facing functionality is broken due to database connection issues and TypeScript compilation errors.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Authentication & User Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to securely authenticate and manage my profile, so that I can participate in setlist voting and follow artists.

## CRITICAL BLOCKERS REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

### 1. Database Connection Failures
- **Issue**: Database test endpoint returns 500 errors
- **Impact**: All data-dependent features are non-functional
- **Priority**: CRITICAL - Must fix first

### 2. TypeScript Compilation Errors
- **Issue**: Build process fails due to missing dependencies and type errors
- **Impact**: Cannot deploy to production
- **Priority**: CRITICAL - Prevents deployment

### 3. Artist Page Rendering Failures
- **Issue**: Artist pages return 500 Internal Server Error
- **Impact**: Core user journey is broken
- **Priority**: HIGH - Primary user feature

### 4. Component Error Handling
- **Issue**: Components fail to render with poor error boundaries
- **Impact**: User experience is severely degraded
- **Priority**: HIGH - User experience

## REALISTIC TIMELINE

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (3-4 weeks)
- Fix database connection issues
- Resolve TypeScript compilation errors
- Implement basic artist and show page functionality
- Complete core user journey from search to view

### Phase 2: Feature Completion (4-6 weeks)
- Implement voting system functionality
- Add real-time updates
- Complete external API data synchronization
- Implement user profile management

### Phase 3: Production Readiness (2-3 weeks)
- Performance optimization
- Security hardening
- Comprehensive testing
- Production deployment

**TOTAL ESTIMATED TIME: 9-13 weeks to production-ready state**

## CONCLUSION

MySetlist has **excellent foundational architecture** but **critical execution gaps** prevent it from being functional. The database schema is sophisticated, the API structure is comprehensive, and the component architecture is well-designed. However, **database connection failures and TypeScript errors** block all core functionality.

**Immediate focus must be on fixing database connectivity and build errors** before attempting any new feature development. The gap between infrastructure and working features is substantial but addressable with focused debugging effort.
