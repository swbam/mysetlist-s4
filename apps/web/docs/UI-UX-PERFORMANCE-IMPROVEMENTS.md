## 📋 PHASE 3: SCRIPTS & AUTOMATION

### ✅ 8. Package.json Integration
**Solution**: Added convenient npm scripts for all testing
```json
{
  "qa:ui-ux": "node scripts/ui-ux-audit.js",
  "qa:accessibility-standalone": "node scripts/accessibility-audit.js", 
  "qa:mobile": "node scripts/mobile-responsiveness-test.js",
  "qa:performance-audit": "node scripts/performance-audit.js"
}
```

**Dependencies Added**:
- `@axe-core/playwright ^4.10.2` - Accessibility testing framework

## 🎯 EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE VALIDATED

### ✅ Mobile Components Already Optimized
**Findings**: Mobile infrastructure is well-implemented
- `apps/web/app/components/mobile/` - Comprehensive mobile components
- `apps/web/components/mobile/` - Touch-optimized UI components
- `apps/web/hooks/use-touch-gestures.ts` - Advanced touch gesture handling
- Mobile navigation with proper animations and accessibility

### ✅ Accessibility Foundation Strong
**Findings**: Good accessibility foundation exists
- `apps/web/test-utils/accessibility.ts` - Testing utilities
- `apps/web/app/(home)/components/accessibility-enhancements.tsx` - Accessibility features
- `apps/web/components/ui/accessibility-utils.tsx` - Utility components
- Skip links, ARIA compliance, reduced motion support

### ✅ Performance Components Memoized
**Findings**: Critical components already optimized
- Voting components properly memoized with React.memo()
- Complex comparison functions for prop optimization
- Performance hooks implemented but needed completion

## 📊 TESTING & VALIDATION SYSTEM

### Test Coverage
- **Accessibility**: 6 core pages × 3 device types = 18 test scenarios
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: 5 pages × 8 device profiles = 40 test scenarios  
- **Performance**: 5 pages with Core Web Vitals + bundle analysis
- **Overall**: 100+ individual test points per audit run
