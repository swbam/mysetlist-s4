# TheSet Database Integrity & Verification Report

**Generated:** August 12, 2025  
**Duration:** Full database integrity testing and sync script verification  
**Status:** ✅ HEALTHY WITH MINOR ISSUES

## Executive Summary

The TheSet database is in good overall health with solid data integrity and working sync systems. All foreign key relationships are valid, no orphaned records were found, and data sync scripts are operational. The main areas for improvement are around filling empty analytical tables and ensuring all shows have proper setlists.

## 📊 Database Overview

### Table Record Counts
| Table | Records | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **artists** | 277 | ✅ Well populated |
| **venues** | 260 | ✅ Well populated |  
| **shows** | 273 | ✅ Well populated |
| **songs** | 278 | ✅ Well populated |
| **setlists** | 10 | ⚠️ Under-populated |
| **setlist_songs** | 52 | ⚠️ Under-populated |
| **artist_songs** | 50 | ⚠️ Partial coverage |
| **show_artists** | 4 | ⚠️ Under-populated |
| **users** | 6 | ℹ️ Test users |
| **votes** | 0 | ⚠️ Empty (no user engagement yet) |
| **artist_stats** | 0 | ⚠️ Empty (analytics not populated) |
| **user_profiles** | 0 | ⚠️ Empty (profiles not created) |

**Total Records:** 1,210 across all tables

### Empty Tables Requiring Attention
- `votes` - No voting activity yet (expected for new system)
- `artist_stats` - Statistics need to be calculated and populated  
- `user_profiles` - User onboarding flow may need improvement

- ✅ All venues have names and cities  
- ✅ All shows have names
- ✅ All songs have titles and artist names
- ✅ All users have email addresses

### 📏 Data Range Validation
- **Artists**: 277 records with valid popularity scores
- **Songs**: 278 records with valid popularity and duration data
- **Venues**: 10 records have capacity data (limited but valid)

## 🎯 Business Logic & Content Issues

### ⚠️ Shows Without Setlists
**Issue:** 263 out of 273 shows (96%) lack setlists  
**Impact:** Users cannot vote on songs for most shows  
**Recommendation:** Run setlist creation scripts or import from external sources

**Sample shows needing setlists:**
- A New York Evening With Old Dominion
- Vince Giordano and the Nighthawks  
- Madlovely, Jokamundo, offering rain

### ⚠️ Incomplete Setlists
**Issue:** 2 out of 10 setlists have no songs  
**Impact:** Empty voting experiences for users  
**Shows affected:**
- Ed Sheeran - Predicted Setlist
- Queen - Predicted Setlist

### ℹ️ Venue Linkage
**Status:** 10 out of 273 shows (4%) are linked to venues  
**Note:** This is expected behavior as venue linking requires Ticketmaster API integration
