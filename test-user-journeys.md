## Critical Issues Found

### üö® CRITICAL: Missing Dropdown Song Selection
**What the docs require:** "Add songs to a setlist from the dropdown on each show page"
**What's implemented:** Search dialog for adding songs
**Impact:** Core user flow broken - users can't easily add songs as specified

### ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUE: Need to verify show/setlist data exists
**Problem:** Can't fully test setlist voting without existing shows with setlists
**Impact:** Unable to verify end-to-end voting workflow

### ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUE: Real-time updates dependencies
**Problem:** Real-time voting updates depend on Supabase realtime being configured
**Impact:** May not work in production without proper realtime setup

## Implementation Assessment

### What's Working Well:
1. **Artist Search & Discovery**: Fully functional with external API integration
2. **Artist Detail Pages**: Complete with shows, following, and content tabs  
3. **Voting System**: Technically complete with proper vote aggregation
4. **Component Architecture**: Well-structured, reusable components
5. **Database Schema**: Comprehensive schema supporting all features

### What Needs Fixing:

#### 1. Song Selection Dropdown (CRITICAL)
- Replace AddSongDialog search with dropdown of artist's popular songs
- Should be directly accessible on show page
- Pre-populate with artist's top tracks from Spotify/database

#### 2. Show/Setlist Data Population
- Need sample shows with setlists to test voting
- Consider adding seed data or test fixtures

#### 3. API Endpoint Verification
- Verify all referenced API endpoints exist and work
- Test `/api/songs/search` endpoint
- Test `/api/artists/[id]/follow` endpoint

## Next Steps Priority

1. **HIGH**: Implement dropdown song selection to match docs specification
2. **MEDIUM**: Create test data (shows + setlists) to verify full workflow  
3. **MEDIUM**: Verify all API endpoints are working
4. **LOW**: Test real-time updates with multiple users

## Recommendation

The core architecture is solid and most features are implemented correctly. The main blocker is the **missing dropdown interface for adding songs** which is explicitly required by the docs. This should be the immediate priority to fix.
