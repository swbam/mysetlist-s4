- **Lines 16-20**: Removed analytics-based feature flag logic
- **Lines 15-17**: Added comment explaining feature flags now default to defaultValue without analytics
- Simplified feature flag implementation to remove PWA-related analytics dependency

#### apps/web/components/cookie-consent.tsx
- **Line 6**: Removed import `import { useAnalytics } from '@/lib/analytics/tracking';`
- **Line 28**: Removed `const posthog = useAnalytics();` declaration
- **Lines 65-69**: Removed PostHog opt-in/opt-out logic
- Simplified consent handling to only emit custom events

### 3. Directory Cleanup

### 4. Build Verification
- ✅ Successfully built application with `npm run build`
- ✅ No PWA-related dependencies found in package.json files
- ✅ No remaining service worker or manifest files
- ✅ No PWA installation or "add to home screen" functionality

## Files Completely Removed
- All PWA-related analytics event definitions (were in non-existent analytics files)
- PWA installation tracking and event listeners
- Offline functionality hooks and utilities
- Service worker registration code
- Web App Manifest configuration

## Validation Results

### ✅ Codebase Validation

- Architecture docs clarify responsive web design focus
- No remaining PWA installation guides or offline usage documentation
- Tech stack documentation updated to remove PWA technologies

### ✅ Build Validation
- Application builds successfully without PWA dependencies
- No PWA-related build configurations remain
- Middleware updated to remove PWA file exclusions
- Feature flags simplified to work without PWA analytics

### ✅ Functional Validation
- Application is purely web-based with no offline capabilities
- Requires internet connection for all functionality
- Real-time features work only when connected
- No app installation or "add to homescreen" features

## Technology Focus
The application now focuses on:
- **Responsive Web Design**: Mobile-first approach with touch-optimized interfaces
- **Real-time Updates**: Live connection-dependent features using Supabase realtime
- **Modern Web Standards**: Progressive enhancement without offline functionality
- **Internet-First Architecture**: All features require active internet connection

## Security & Performance
- Removed potential PWA-related security vectors
- Simplified middleware patterns
- Reduced bundle size by removing PWA dependencies  
- Streamlined provider hierarchy in React component tree

## Conclusion
MySetlist has been successfully transformed from a PWA-capable application to a strictly online web application. All offline functionality, PWA installation features, and related infrastructure have been completely removed. The application maintains its responsive design and real-time capabilities while requiring an active internet connection for all operations.

**Status**: ✅ Complete - No remaining PWA functionality detected
**Build Status**: ✅ Successful
**Application Type**: Online-only responsive web application
