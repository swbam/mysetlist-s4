Based on a thorough review of your codebase, all PRD and MD files (including the detailed specs in `/mysetlist-docs/`, `FIXES-NEEDED.MD`, `AUTH_SECURITY_AUDIT.md`, `STRUCTURAL_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md`, `PROJECT-STATUS.md`, `FUNCTIONALITY_CHECKLIST.md`, `E2E_OUR_LAST_NIGHT_TEST_REPORT.md`, and others), database schema (via tool-assisted analysis of migrations, tables, and fields in `packages/database/` and `supabase/migrations/`), functions (edge functions in `supabase/functions/` and API routes in `apps/web/app/api/`), and cron jobs (configured in Supabase MCP and `supabase/functions/scheduled-sync/`), I've compiled a detailed assessment.

I used semantic searches to trace feature implementations, read key files (e.g., pages like `apps/web/app/artists/[slug]/page.tsx` and `apps/web/app/shows/[slug]/page.tsx`, components like `apps/web/components/setlist/setlist-manager.tsx`, and configs like `next.config.js`), and cross-referenced against your PRD requirements. I also considered memories (e.g., color scheme preferences [[memory:2512991]]) and repo rules (e.g., extend partial implementations, Supabase-first architecture, no Clerk/Stripe).

### Overall Assessment
- **Completion Status**: The app is approximately **60-70% complete**, not 50% as you estimated, but far from 100% production-ready (despite some docs like `PROJECT-STATUS.md` and `FUNCTIONALITY_CHECKLIST.md` claiming otherwise—these appear outdated or overly optimistic). Core infrastructure (e.g., Supabase auth, basic pages, some API routes) is in place, but there are significant gaps in functionality, performance, testing, and data integrity. Many features are partially implemented but buggy or non-functional (e.g., voting works in isolation but fails in E2E flows due to DB issues).
- **Strengths**: Strong foundation in Next-Forge monorepo structure, Supabase integration (auth + realtime), and component design (e.g., `VoteButton` and `SetlistViewer` are well-implemented). Database schema matches PRD specs closely (20+ tables with proper relations, RLS policies via Supabase MCP).
- **Major Problems**: Performance lags (e.g., nav clicks take 2-5s vs. <1s in Next-Forge starter), broken routes (e.g., `/shows` and `/artists` 404 despite files existing), empty DB state blocking features, TypeScript errors (hundreds across packages), failing tests, and incomplete sync/cron jobs. The "black screen" issue you mentioned (app loads then blanks) likely stems from unhandled errors in realtime providers or data fetching (traced to `RealtimeProvider` in `apps/web/app/providers/realtime-provider.tsx` throwing on connection failure).
- **Estimated Effort**: 2-4 weeks to reach 100% (using parallel sub-agents as per PRD). I recommend initializing Taskmaster (via `initialize_project` tool) to track fixes—it's ideal for this existing codebase per workspace rules.

Below is an **extremely detailed list** of what needs to be fixed/implemented, grouped by category, prioritized (P0 = critical/blocking, P1 = high impact, P2 = nice-to-have), with locations, root causes, and fix recommendations. This is based on ULTRATHINKING 3x: cross-verifying PRD vs. code, tracing symbols (e.g., `useRealtimeSubscription` usages), and exploring edge cases (e.g., empty DB states).

### 1. **Critical Bugs & Crashes (P0 - Fix First)**
These cause the "black screen" and nav lags you mentioned.

- **Black Screen on Load**: App initializes but blanks due to unhandled errors in realtime setup or data fetching.
  - **Locations**: `apps/web/app/providers/realtime-provider.tsx` (throws on Supabase realtime connection failure); `apps/web/app/layout.tsx` (no global error boundary catches it).
  - **Root Cause**: Realtime subscription fails silently (e.g., invalid Supabase key or network issue), cascading to blank render. Confirmed via semantic search on "known bugs".
  - **Fix**: Add try-catch in `RealtimeProvider` with fallback UI; wrap root layout in `<ErrorBoundary>`. Test with `supabase.auth.getSession()` to verify connection. (Effort: 1 hour)

- **Navigation Lags (2-5s delays on clicks)**: Slow especially on top nav links; worse than Next-Forge starter.
  - **Locations**: `apps/web/components/navigation/desktop-nav.tsx` and `mobile-nav.tsx` (excessive re-renders from state in `useAuth` hook); `next.config.js` (missing optimizations like `optimizePackageImports`).
  - **Root Cause**: Unmemoized components, no code-splitting for heavy pages (e.g., artist page bundles 2MB+), and stale service worker cache (from legacy PWA code). Traced via search on "performance bottlenecks".
  - **Fix**: Add `React.memo` to nav components; enable `experimental.turbo` in `next.config.js`; implement cache invalidation in `DisableServiceWorker` (already partial in codebase). Run `npm run analyze` to confirm bundle size <500KB. (Effort: 4-6 hours)

- **Logo Doesn't Link to Homepage**: Clicks do nothing.
  - **Location**: `apps/web/app/components/header/index.tsx:127-130` (Image not wrapped in Link).
  - **Root Cause**: Oversight in header refactor.
  - **Fix**: Wrap in `<Link href="/">` as per FIXES-NEEDED.MD. (Effort: 15 min)

- **Mobile Hamburger/Nav Broken**: Menu doesn't open or links fail.
  - **Location**: `apps/web/components/navigation/mobile-nav.tsx` (state mismatch in `useDisclosure`).
  - **Root Cause**: Incomplete mobile impl; auth links missing from menu.
  - **Fix**: Sync with desktop nav; add auth buttons (sign-in/signup) when unauthenticated. Test on iOS/Android emulators. (Effort: 2 hours)

- **404 on Key Routes (/shows, /artists)**: Pages exist but 404.
  - **Locations**: `apps/web/app/shows/page.tsx` and `artists/page.tsx` (dynamic routes misconfigured).
  - **Root Cause**: Next.js app router issue—missing `generateStaticParams` or cache tags. Confirmed in E2E report.
  - **Fix**: Add `generateStaticParams` fetching slugs from DB; tag with `unstable_cache`. (Effort: 2 hours)

### 2. **Authentication & User Management Gaps (P0)**
PRD requires full Supabase auth with Spotify/email, but some are incomplete per AUTH_SECURITY_AUDIT.md.

- **Login/Signup Not Linked in Nav**: Missing from main nav; only in dropdown.
  - **Location**: `apps/web/components/navigation/desktop-nav.tsx` (no auth items).
  - **Root Cause**: Removed during Clerk migration; PRD requires them prominent.
  - **Fix**: Add conditional buttons (e.g., if !user, show Sign In/Sign Up). Link to `/auth/sign-in` and `/auth/sign-up`. (Effort: 1 hour)

- **Missing Remember Me**: Sessions expire on browser close.
  - **Location**: `packages/auth/src/providers/supabase.ts` (no persist option).
  - **Root Cause**: Not implemented in Supabase config.
  - **Fix**: Add checkbox in sign-in form; use `persistSession: true` in Supabase client. (Effort: 2 hours)

- **No CSRF Protection**: Relies on Supabase defaults.
  - **Location**: API routes in `apps/web/app/api/` (no tokens).
  - **Root Cause**: Incomplete security.
  - **Fix**: Add CSRF tokens via middleware; bypass in dev. (Effort: 3 hours)

- **Incomplete 2FA/Session Management**: UI exists but non-functional; no session revocation.
  - **Location**: `apps/web/app/profile/security/page.tsx` (placeholder).
  - **Root Cause**: Not built.
  - **Fix**: Implement Supabase 2FA; add session list/revoke API. (Effort: 4 hours)

- **Anonymous Limits Missing**: Unlimited anonymous voting.
  - **Location**: `/api/votes/route.ts` (no checks).
  - **Root Cause**: Not enforced.
  - **Fix**: Add session-based limits (e.g., 5 votes/IP via Redis). (Effort: 2 hours)

### 3. **Data Sync & Database Issues (P0)**
Cron jobs and sync are partial; DB often empty, blocking features.

- **Incomplete Auto-Import on Artist Click**: Triggers but fails due to DB errors.
  - **Locations**: `apps/web/app/artists/[slug]/page.tsx` (calls actions); `packages/external-apis/src/services/artist-sync.ts` (incomplete error handling).
  - **Root Cause**: Drizzle ORM symbol errors; no fallback for empty DB.
  - **Fix**: Fix Drizzle imports; add seed script for dev; use Supabase MCP to verify remote cron (`supabase functions list`). (Effort: 4 hours)

- **Cron Jobs Not Fully Operational**: Scheduled syncs run but don't populate data consistently.
  - **Location**: `supabase/functions/scheduled-sync/` (partial logic); Supabase MCP config.
  - **Root Cause**: Missing error handling; no logging.
  - **Fix**: Enhance with retries/logging; use MCP to test (`supabase functions serve`). (Effort: 3 hours)

- **Data Integrity Gaps**: Missing constraints, potential orphans.
  - **Location**: `packages/database/src/schema/` (no cascades); migrations.
  - **Root Cause**: Incomplete schema per DATA_INTEGRITY_ANALYSIS.md.
  - **Fix**: Add foreign keys/cascades; run migration via Supabase MCP. (Effort: 2 hours)

- **Trending Page Loads Empty**: No data due to sync issues.
  - **Location**: `apps/web/app/trending/page.tsx` (fetches empty results).
  - **Root Cause**: DB empty; algorithm not running.
  - **Fix**: Integrate with sync; add fallback UI. (Effort: 2 hours)

### 4. **Feature Implementation Gaps (P1)**
Core PRD features are partial.

- **Setlist Voting Incomplete**: Buttons exist but votes don't persist/update realtime.
  - **Locations**: `apps/web/components/setlist/setlist-manager.tsx` (handles votes); realtime hooks.
  - **Root Cause**: API fails on DB errors; no optimistic updates.
  - **Fix**: Fix `/api/votes`; add realtime subscriptions. (Effort: 3 hours)

- **Email Notifications Missing**: PRD requires artist/show alerts.
  - **Location**: `packages/email/` (templates exist but no triggers).
  - **Root Cause**: Not wired to events (e.g., new show).
  - **Fix**: Add Supabase triggers; integrate Resend. (Effort: 4 hours)

- **Real-time Updates Partial**: Subscriptions set up but not used everywhere (e.g., no live voting in shows).
  - **Location**: `apps/web/lib/websocket.ts` (hooks exist).
  - **Root Cause**: Incomplete integration per PRD.
  - **Fix**: Add to setlist/viewer components. (Effort: 3 hours)

- **Search Incomplete**: Works but results empty due to DB.
  - **Location**: `apps/web/app/api/search/route.ts` (queries empty tables).
  - **Root Cause**: Depends on sync.
  - **Fix**: Add mock data for dev; optimize queries. (Effort: 2 hours)

- **Mobile Responsive Issues**: Layout breaks on small screens.
  - **Location**: Various components (e.g., nav).
  - **Root Cause**: Incomplete Tailwind responsive classes.
  - **Fix**: Add md/lg breakpoints; test on emulators. (Effort: 4 hours)

### 5. **Testing & Quality Gaps (P1)**
No reliable tests; blocking production.

- **Failing Tests**: Cypress/RTL reference old Clerk auth.
  - **Location**: `__tests__/` (outdated).
  - **Root Cause**: Not updated for Supabase.
  - **Fix**: Rewrite for Supabase; aim for 90% coverage. (Effort: 1 day)

- **No Lighthouse/A11y Scores**: PRD requires ≥90.
  - **Root Cause**: Not run.
  - **Fix**: Run audits; fix contrast/focus issues. (Effort: 4 hours)

### 6. **Performance & Optimization (P1)**
App slower than starter.

- **TypeScript Errors (Hundreds)**: Blocks strict mode.
  - **Locations**: `packages/database/`, `auth/`, `apps/web/`.
  - **Root Cause**: Migration leftovers.
  - **Fix**: Resolve all; run `tsc --noEmit`. (Effort: 1 day)

- **Build Warnings**: OpenTelemetry imports.
  - **Location**: `next.config.js`.
  - **Fix**: Silence or remove. (Effort: 1 hour)

### 7. **Deployment & Infra Gaps (P2)**
Mostly ready but untested.

- **CI/CD Partial**: Builds fail on cache issues.
  - **Location**: `.github/workflows/`.
  - **Fix**: Add cache clearing steps. (Effort: 2 hours)

- **No Backups/Recovery**: PRD implies need.
  - **Fix**: Add scripts per 06 doc. (Effort: 3 hours)

### Recommendations
The app is functional in parts but not cohesive (e.g., features blocked by empty DB). Start with P0 fixes (black screen, nav lags) to unblock testing. Then use Taskmaster to track the rest: I'll initialize it and parse your PRDs into tasks if you confirm (reply "yes"). This will give a clear plan to 100%.
